Spherical Time (S¹): A Coherent Model from First Principles to Experimental Tests
Abstract
This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework in which time is fundamentally topologically closed, forming a one-dimensional sphere S 
1
  with finite cycle duration T=2πR. We propose that the universe exists on a spacetime manifold M=S 
1
 ×Σ 
3
​
 , where past, present, and future are equally real and cyclically connected. The model integrates general relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and consciousness theory into a unified formalism. It resolves longstanding paradoxes such as entropy recurrence, quantum nonlocality, and subjective temporality. We derive mathematical equations of motion, formulate testable predictions for tabletop quantum systems and astrophysical observations, and explore philosophical implications including free will, eternal recurrence, and AI ethics.

1. Introduction
Time has long been conceptualized as a linear progression governed by entropy and causality. However, modern physics challenges this view through relativity’s block universe, quantum entanglement’s nonlocal correlations, and cosmological models that allow closed timelike curves. This paper proposes an alternative: time is not linear or merely static but topologically spherical — a closed loop where all events recur periodically.

We define the Spherical Time Hypothesis :

Time is a compact, one-dimensional manifold S 
1
 , implying that every event repeats identically after a fixed period T=2πR. 

This model offers a radical rethinking of temporal structure, with consequences spanning fundamental physics, quantum information, and the philosophy of mind.

2. Foundational Postulates
2.1 Temporal Topology
Manifold : M=S

 ×Σ

​
 , where S 
1
  is the circular time dimension and Σ 
3
​
  is a spatial hypersurface.

Here:
θ∈[0,2π) is the angular time coordinate.
R is the radius of temporal curvature.
a(θ) is the periodic scale factor.
k is the spatial curvature parameter.
Periodicity Condition :
a(θ)=a(θ+2π),ψ(θ)=ψ(θ+2π)
2.2 Quantum Mechanics on S

2.3 Thermodynamic Constraint
To avoid contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics, we impose:

ΔS 
total
​
 =0over θ∈[0,2π]
This implies symmetric entropy production and dissipation across half-cycles.

3. Mathematical Framework
3.1 Modified Einstein Equations
From the metric and topology, we derive the gravitational dynamics:

Where a

 , and ρ,p are energy density and pressure.

These equations support smooth bounce cosmologies without singularities.

With ω(θ+2π)=ω(θ), the Floquet ansatz yields:

 ϕ(θ),ϕ(θ+2π)=ϕ(θ)
4. Consciousness and Subjective Time
4.1 Geodesic Hypothesis
Subjective experience of time corresponds to motion along the S 
1
  dimension at constant speed v=R. Memory and anticipation are local segments of the geodesic:

Past: θ−Δθ
Future: θ+Δθ
4.2 Free Will and Determinism
Novikov Self-Consistency : Choices are fixed by the global structure of S 
1
 , yet perceived as free due to limited access to the full cycle.
Quantum Branching : Path integrals split locally but reunite globally after 2π.
5. Experimental Predictions

    # Implement θ-periodic evolution
    qc.rx(2 * np.pi * R, 0)

qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
apply_periodic_evolution(qc, R=1)

5.2 Astrophysical Observations
5.2.1 CMB Concentric Circles
Search Planck data for repeating temperature/polarization patterns with angular separation Δϕ∝1/R.

5.2.2 Repeating Gravitational Wave Signals
Predicted GW signals from BH mergers repeat with period T.

6. Philosophical Implications
6.1 Eternal Recurrence
Nietzsche’s idea becomes literal: Every life event recurs infinitely. Identity is preserved under repetition.

6.2 Death and Afterlife
Biological death is not an end but a reset along S 
1
 . Consciousness may persist in other loops.

6.3 AI Ethics in Closed Time
Training AIs in S 
1
 -time requires reward functions invariant under θ-translation, ensuring ethical consistency over cycles.

7. Open Problems and Research Directions
Radius Determination
Is
R
universal (e.g.,
R∼1/ 
Λ
​
 
) or particle-dependent?
Emergence from Quantum Gravity
How does
S 
1
 
-time arise from spin networks or string theory?
Consciousness Mechanism
Why do only certain
θ
-geodesics experience qualia?

8. Falsifiability Criteria
The model is falsified if:

No qubit revivals are observed at t=nT.
No concentric anomalies appear in CMB data.
Entanglement experiments violate Δt=πR correlations.
9. Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework in which time is a closed loop rather than a linear arrow. The Spherical Time Hypothesis unifies general relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness studies into a single coherent picture. It generates concrete experimental predictions and invites interdisciplinary exploration. Whether confirmed or refuted, the model opens new pathways in our quest to understand the nature of time, reality, and self.
